You wake up in a dimly lit room on a boat. You&#39;re on your way to an island to inquire about an unsolved murder-mystery that took place fifty years ago. Straight in front of the bed is the [[door]] leading out of the room and to the right of the bed is a [[desk]] cluttered with what seems to papers.

[[Alfred Jones-&gt;Alfred]] was brutually murdered on the 21st of February 1950 by an unknown assailant. Jones was a very wealthy man with a number of resorts on the island.
I&#39;ve been sent by the bureau to investigate the mystery and with any luck solve it.

To do this, I must travel to the island and search it for anything that the investigators at the time &#39;&#39;&#39;missed&#39;&#39;&#39; due to bribary or fearmongering by [[Edward-&gt;edward traits act1]].

Only time will tell if I&#39;ll be able to solve this mystery, and relieve this once great island of the despair and horrow it&#39;s bottled for over half a century...</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="list of suspects" tags="" position="173,535" size="100,100">&#39;&#39;List of Suspects&#39;&#39;

He was visiting [[Alfred]] at the time of the murder in relation to a possible merger, something out of character when one takes into account the nature of their relationship.

It is no secret that Edward and Alfred did not get along as one man&#39;s richs is another man&#39;s poison and this held through throughout their respectively successful careers.

Edward was feared by many and was seen to be a man of little sympathy, cold towards those close to him and sinister to those who went against him...

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="edward looks act1" tags="" position="130,825" size="100,100">Edward was a short and plump man, he was well fed so to speak.

Although short is height, he seemed to tower over people with his presence.

He also carried a lisp which suprisingly never took away from his serious manner.

Always well dressed and sporting a top hat as to hide the fact that he had prematurely balded.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="edward motive act1" tags="" position="260,825" size="100,100">[[Edward-&gt;Edward Shanks]] and [[Alfred]] never seemed to get along. When one would rise, the other would fall.

This seemed aparant when Alfred opened a resort two miles down the road from Edward&#39;s main premise.

Edward&#39;s revenue went into a sharp decline and more importantly his pride crippled with the decay of what was his most prized posession.

This, accompanied with his charming personality and reputation is why he was named as the &#39;&#39;&#39;prime suspect&#39;&#39; in the investigation, oh so many years ago.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="edward alibi act1" tags="" position="378,825" size="100,100">Edward claimed that he was out drinking with associates at the time.
Due to his status and nature, this was never questioned and he was soon relieved of any suspicion.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="jason traits act1" tags="" position="558,701" size="100,100">Jason seems to a quiet and well spoken individual who keeps to himself.

She also always seems to have a large smile even when angry. Seems like a skill she learnt from her days as a news anchor.

Kenny is a bit shorter then Lyla, has dark hair with a few grey hairs throughout. His hair is thinning on the top.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="Whitworth motive act1" tags="" position="280,1188" size="100,100">A few weeks after the murder Kenny was let go and people did not think they would be ok financially, expecially because they filled for devorce around the same time. But they both seemed to bounce back ok which means they may have robbed [[Alfred]] to stop them going broke and then murdered him when they were cought.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="Whitworth alibi act1" tags="" position="405,1176" size="100,100">They say they were at the beach and there was witnesses saying they heard them arguing. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name=" Tomahawk" tags="" position="787,795" size="100,100">Small island off the coast of Portugal.

After the murder of [[Alfred Jones-&gt;Alfred]] in 1950, it lost most of it&#39;s resorts to bankruptcy, as most of them were owned by Alfred and went bust. Although, several resorts boomed because of this, most owned by [[Edward Shanks-&gt;edward traits act1]] whom seemed to make a killing(pun intended) off the disaster.

Sadly the island never returned to it&#39;s former glory and to this day, a shadow of despair and mystery daunt the island and the people who inhabit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="Alfred" tags="" position="293,394" size="100,100">&#39;&#39;Alfred Jones&#39;&#39;

It&#39;s reported that through the quiet season the year the crime happened, he employed and forced one individual to clean the grounds and run the reception, which reportidly drove him to the brink of insanity.

Previous to the events of the murder, Alfred left his wife and their son for a much younger woman, something that was shunned by the community of [[ Tomahawk]] which he never lived down and with it brought many new enemies.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="alfred looks act1" tags="" position="369,216" size="100,100">Alfred was a plump man, always panting due to his excess weight and although possessed the riches of the world, kept himself in terrible shape.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
